Linked list is the data structure in which elements are stored in nodes. Each nodes contains data and a pointer (or reference) to the next node in the sequence. 
Linked list allow for efficient insertion and deletion of elements since they dont require the elements to be stored in contiguous memory locations.

Types of linked lists
1) Single linked list: each node points to the next node in the sequence
2) Double linked list: each node points to both the next node and the previous node.
3) Circular linked list: The last node points to the first node, forming a circular chain.

Big O Notation: 
1) access time: O(n)
2) Search time: O(n)
3) insertion time: O(1) (if the pointer to the node to be inserted is known)
4) deletion time: O(1) (if the pointer to the node to be deleted is known)

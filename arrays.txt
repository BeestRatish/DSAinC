/*
Basic Info at first:
array is the collection of element, all of the same type, stored in contagious memory locations
1) to declare: we use: int fruits[4]; // this is an array of 4 fruits
2) initialization: int fruits[4] = {"apple","banana","pineapple","strawberry"}
3) if not all elements are initialized, the remaining elements will set to 0 by default
    int fruits[5] = {"dragonfruit","kiwi"}
4) accessing elements
    int first = fruits[0];
    fruits[4] = "orange";

Advances Concepts: Multidimensional Arrays: 
    2D arrays: array of arrays. int matrix[3][4];
    int matrix[2][3] = {{1,3,5},{4,5,6}}

accessing elements: 
    int element = matrix[1][2];
    matrix[0][1]=7;

ArrayPointers
    name of the array acts as a pointer to its first element.
    int *ptr = numbers;
pointer arithmetic can be used to navigate throught the array:
    int value = *(ptr + 2);
